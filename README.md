# LOGISTICS-PLANNING
 This project simulates a courier visiting 5 customer locations in a 10x10 matrix, starting and ending at (0,0). The matrix contains random travel costs, and the courierâ€™s route is planned to minimize these costs. Customer locations and total travel costs are saved in a "Cost.txt" file.
